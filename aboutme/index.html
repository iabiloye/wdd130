    <h2>Abiloye</h2>
    <p>My name is Abiloye Iynauoluwa John, from West Africa, Nigeria.
    I was born in the month of November in Ibadan, presently I reside in Calabar,Nigeria.
    I work at Heineken Breweries. I do not have much time for hobbies this day so I maintain 
    chatting, it as always been movies and travelling but soon I will catch up with fun time. BYU-Idaho 
    has really been more comfortable for me with the privilege to learn as a team and build one another as 
    we learn both secular and gospel lesson together.</p>
    <p>I study Electronics Engineering here in my country and presently with BYUI am studying Web and Computer programming,
    with much success see myself as a Biomedical Engineer and a Programmer.</p>
    <p>I was born into the church and have had beautiful privilege to learn as I grow, am glad to be part of this 
    big family and study together. I enjoy technology and am sure our class with be one that will give great experince and 
    lesson. Thanks you for looking at my introduction page. </p>
