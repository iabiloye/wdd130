      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p>
        Donut shops have excellent margins, because the pastry sells as a standalone product. So making money in the donut business is entirely possible. Creative recipes, marketing and a low overhead business model can drive revenue in this business. Many donut shops are successful and profitable in the U.S. Look to prolific donut-focused chains like Dunkin' Donuts and Krispy Creme for further confirmation that profit potential exists in the donut business. </p>

      <h3>Stories</h3>
      <p>
        Competition has a major influence on your ability to succeed at selling donuts. Location-dependent shops must focus on high traffic areas with great exposure. Select areas that are not near major chain stores to grab the maximum amount of market share in a locale. Selling creative donuts that combine unique flavors like bacon and maple can distinguish a business through higher quality products. Mobile businesses and delivery models can expand into a larger area and increase the profit potential. Office delivery and event catering are both effective sales strategies. </p>

      <p>         
        Most everyone has experienced the pleasant sensation of walking into a bakery and smelling the sweet aroma of fresh-baked goods right out of the oven. In an age where prepackaged and frozen foods dominate the retail grocery industry, bakeries provide a refreshing alternative and wide variety of delicious treats.</p>

      <h3>Products</h3>
      <p> 
        <strong>Breads</strong><br>
Bakeries produce a wide variety of breads including rye, Italian and pumpernickel. Breads are one of the oldest forms of food in the world and are made by baking dough, a flour and water mixture. Other ingredients such as salt, fat, milk, sugar, baking soda and yeast can be added. Breads come in a variety of forms, including rolls and loaves. Other common ingredients in bread include nuts, seeds and vegetables.

<br><strong>Doughnuts</strong><br>
Doughnuts provide a tasty snack and can be eaten for breakfast. Usually sweet and deep fried, doughnuts come with a hole in the middle or as a solid piece filled with items such as jelly, creams or custards. Doughnuts can be baked in an oven instead of deep fried. Common doughnut toppings include powdered sugar, glaze and caramel. The two main types of doughnuts include yeast and cake. Yeast doughnuts are lighter and fluffier. Cake doughnuts tend to be heavier. The majority of doughnuts have a round shape.

<br><strong>Bagels</strong><br>
Bagels, popular breakfast items, are usually made of yeast wheat dough and come in the form of a ring. Bagels have a thick and tough exterior that is crisp and often browned. Common bagel toppings include poppy and sesame seeds. Most bakeries carry bagels, although bagel shops specialize in bagels only.

<br><strong>Pies</strong><br>
Bakeries sell pies as dessert items. A pie is a baked dish consisting of layers of pastry dough that form a shell and have sweet or sour fillings. Pies can also be filled with meat and eaten as a dinner, however such pies are rarely found in bakeries. Some traditional varieties of pies sold in bakeries include apple, strawberry, blackberry, cherry, cream, custard, key lime and lemon meringue.

<br><strong>Pastries</strong><br>
Pastries refer to baked goods made with ingredients that often include butter, sugar, shortening, flour, baking powder and eggs. Pastries, higher in fat content than breads, include small desserts and quiches. Other types include Danish pastry and croissants.

      <h3>Stories</h3>

        <strong>It’s Only Childish When Someone Else Is Doing It</strong><br>       
        Two customers approach my counter; one gets to me seconds before the other. The one coming in last huffs but accepts her position in the queue.<br>
<strong><strong>Customer #1:</strong></strong> “I’d like that last piece of London cheesecake, please.”

Immediately, [Customer #2] interjects.<br>

<strong>Customer #2:</strong> “No! I wanted that! Don’t give it to her!”<br>

<strong>Customer #1:</strong> “Uh… no, I was here first. Sorry, but I want it.”<br>

<strong>Customer #2:</strong> *To me* “No! I want that! I am the customer, and I am telling you not to give it to her!’<br>

Me: “Sorry, madam, but she is a customer, too, and I am serving her first. I’m sorry, but we’re now out of that item.”<br>

<strong>Customer #2:</strong> “No!”<br>

She literally stomps her foot.

<strong>Customer #2:</strong> “That’s not fair! We both came in together!”<br>

<strong>Customer #1:</strong> “But I got here first, so I get served first.”<br>

<strong>Customer #2:</strong> “Why can’t you just let me have it?”<br>

<strong>Customer #1:</strong> “Because I want it?”<br>

<strong>Customer #2:</strong> *To me* “You need to kick them out!”<br>

Me: “I can’t do that, madam.”<br>

<strong>Customer #2:</strong> “But they’re behaving like a child!”<br>

Me: “Excuse me, madam, but you’re the one stomping your foot because you didn’t get to go first.”

She actually stomped her foot again and made a noise halfway between a scream and a whimper. My years of working in customer service have taught me that this is the “I always get my way, so when I don’t, I can’t process it” noise. With that, she stormed out.<br>
