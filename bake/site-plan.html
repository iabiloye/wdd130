        Donut shops have excellent margins, because the pastry sells as a standalone product. So making money in the donut business is entirely possible. Creative recipes, marketing and a low overhead business model can drive revenue in this business. Many donut shops are successful and profitable in the U.S. Look to prolific donut-focused chains like Dunkin' Donuts and Krispy Creme for further confirmation that profit potential exists in the donut business. </p>

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        Competition has a major influence on your ability to succeed at selling donuts. Location-dependent shops must focus on high traffic areas with great exposure. Select areas that are not near major chain stores to grab the maximum amount of market share in a locale. Selling creative donuts that combine unique flavors like bacon and maple can distinguish a business through higher quality products. Mobile businesses and delivery models can expand into a larger area and increase the profit potential. Office delivery and event catering are both effective sales strategies. </p>
